# Determines which resources bypass the security filter chain altogether.
# This is important for more than efficiency as, without it, you might find
# the security system trying to redirect to one of these resources after a
# login, which won't work in a variety of odd ways.
# So, whenever you add a folder to /src/main/resources/public, you'll probably
# want to add it here, too.
